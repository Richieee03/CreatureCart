# 🐾 CreatureCart: E-Commerce Website for Pet Needs

## 🌟 Overview
**CreatureCart** is an e-commerce platform designed specifically for pet-related products, developed by a team of four. The main goal of the website is to provide a seamless shopping experience for pet owners. The platform supports three types of users: **Guests**, **Registered Users**, and **Admins**.

- **Guests** can:
  - Browse products and categories
  - View product details
  - Sign up or log in

- **Registered Users** can:
  - Purchase products
  - View transaction history
  - Participate in product discussions
  - Manage their profiles

- **Admins** can:
  - Access the admin panel to manage products, categories, transactions, user accounts, and discussions on the platform

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** `Bootstrap`, `CSS`, `HTML`, `JavaScript`
- **Backend:** `PHP`
- **Database:** `MySQL`
- **Tools:**
  - `XAMPP` for local server
  - `Visual Studio Code` for code editing
  - `Google Chrome` for testing and debugging

## ⚙️ Challenges

One of the key challenges was implementing **User Authorization Management**, which distinguishes between guest, registered user, and admin access levels. Creating an intuitive admin panel that allows admins to manage the website's various components required careful structuring. 

This challenge was overcome by:
- Implementing session management in PHP
- Tailoring access logic based on user roles

Additionally, integrating the frontend with the backend required multiple iterations, particularly in ensuring smooth transactions and effective communication between user interactions and the database.

## 🚀 Current Status

The website is currently fully functional in a local environment using **XAMPP**. All key features — including product purchasing, profile management, and the admin panel — have been thoroughly tested and work as expected. While the site hasn't been deployed live yet, it's ready for local use and can be further developed for online deployment.
